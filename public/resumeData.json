    "bio": " I have an entrepreneurial spirit that was born from my passion for eCommerce.  At the age of 15, I started up my own eCommerce company, Blue Rock Jewelry that focused on retail fashion.  I had to create and implement a website that provided products and services that fulfilled customer orders online.  I then became involved in financial stocks markets, crypto and other eCommerce businesses.  This fuelled a passion for software development that led me to pursue my diploma in Software Development at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT). ",
